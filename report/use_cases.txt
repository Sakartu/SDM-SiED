Use Cases
=========

In our solution there are two subjects, the consultant and the client. We assume
that there is only one consultant (who has administration rights in the
system) and that there are multiple clients. The consultant handles the
financial data for his/her clients and is also responsible for all key
management. After a client made him/herself known to the consultant and the
consultant handled the appropriate key setup the client can insert and query
his/her own financial data. We support the following use-cases:

Consultant
----------

1. Insert a new client 
2. Insert new data for a client
3. Query data for a specific client or for all clients

Client
------

1. Insert new data for him/herself
2. Query his/her own data
